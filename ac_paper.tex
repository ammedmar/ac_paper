% Outline:
% 1. Andrews-Curtis conjecture
% 2. Reinforcement Learning
% 3. Progress and current challenges
% 4.

% Successes:
% 1. We are able to find the shortest sequence of AC moves that trivializes AK(2) with maximum length = 7.

% Main troubles:

% 1. Say we have solved AK(2) for maximum length = 7 (which we have). We want to solve it again after setting maximum length = 20. Now we have to do hyperparameter search again, and there is no guarantee that we will find a good set of hyperparameters in the same range that we used while conducting hyperparamter search for (AK(2), 7). This is a time consuming and resource intensive process with possibly requiring thousands of experiments to be run.

% Possible solutions:
% a). Based on the hyperparameters for the best run of (AK(2), 7), there is a (possibly clever) set of hyperparameters for which (AK(2), 20) will be near optimal.
% b). So far, I have only used random search. Maybe using a more sophisticated search approach will cut down time. I think Ray Tune has some sophisticated search algorithms that 'stop bad runs early, save intermediate results, restart from previous trials, or pause and resume runs'.
% b). Use maximum update parameterization.

% 2. Policy gradient algorithms can learn to do better if they solve the problem in the first place. With very large maximum length such as

% Possible directions:
% 1. In addition to AK(3) (which has been focus of our work so far), try running experiments for presentations of the other family (the one that's parameterized by w). We have a list of these presentations up to maximum length=20,
