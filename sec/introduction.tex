	\caption{The figure shows the number of presentations from the Miller-Schupp series that were solved using Greedy Search (GS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) as a function of \( n \). Greedy Search consistently outperforms Breadth-First Search. Specifically, Greedy Search successfully solved all 170 presentations of the Miller-Schupp series with \( n=1 \) in our dataset.} \label{fig:performance}

Mention that presentations solved by PPO and BFS are a subset of those solved by GS.
