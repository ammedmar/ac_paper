	\begin{algorithmic}[1] % The number [1] ensures lines are numbered
		\State \textbf{Input:} A balanced presentation $\pi$, maximal size of presentation $n$
		\State \textbf{Output:} set of enumerated presentations connected to starting presentations that are achievable without exceeding size limit; and set of egdes with filtrations
		\State Initialize a queue $Q$, set of visited nodes $visited$, numerical map $name$ that will enumerate presentations
		\State Put $\pi$ as visited, into queue $Q$ and give it number $0$.
