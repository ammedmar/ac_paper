\subsection*{Acknowledgment}

We would like to thank Danil Akhtiamov, Anna Beliakova, Jessica Craven, Michael Douglas, Konstantin Korovin, Alexei Lisitsa, Maksymilian Manko, Ciprian Manolescu, Fabian Ruehle, Josef Urban, and Tony Yue Yu for insightful discussions and comments. We especially want to thank Anna Beliakova for igniting our interest in the Andrews--Curtis conjecture as a framework for exploring problems with long and rare sequences of moves that an RL agent must discover.
