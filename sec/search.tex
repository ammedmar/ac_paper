\section{Breadth first search}






We use the algorithm presented in Algorithm \autoref{alg:bfs} to classify these examples as solved or unsolved.
For each presentation $R_0$, we start with a heap $H$ and a set $S$; each of them containing only $R_0$.
The heap $H$ is ordered by a tuple $(n, m)$ where $n$ is the total length of a presentation and $m$ is the length of the sequence of AC moves connecting a presentation and $R_0$.
The size of the tree grows extremely fast\footnote{Something like $n^k$?}, hence we put a hard cutoff on the number of nodes of the tree.
If the algorithm finds the trivial presentation, we consider the starting presentation $R_0$ 'BFS-easy'; else, we consider it a 'BFS-hard' example.
\footnote{Justify the BFS name.}
\footnote{Note that the choice of $10^6$ nodes is based entirely on computational convenience.
With this choice, we found that each example took 1-2 minutes to process.
For 1190 presentations, this amounted to approximately 20 hours.
Can this be made more precise maybe in terms of CPU time?}
\footnote{The sequence we first encounter depends on the choice of sequence of AC moves in the for loop.
What is that sequence in our case?}
\footnote{Isn't S a set instead of a list? Specify what Actions, H, $N_f$ mean in our case.
Why should this algorithm be called BFS?}

		\Return{True}

		\State $S \gets RA$

\end{algorithm}

The number of BFS-hard examples increases as a function of $n$.
(See \autoref{fig:hist_vs_n}.)
The distributions of BFS-easy and BFS-hard as a function of the total length of a presentation are also given in \autoref{fig:hist_vs_length}.
