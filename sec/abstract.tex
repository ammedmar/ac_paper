\begin{abstract}
    Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple angles, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the mathematical context defined by the Andrews--Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic improvements that can be relevant in other domains with ultra-sparse reward problems.
    In the course of this study, we also address several open mathematical questions. Specifically, we demonstrate the length reducibility of all but two presentations in the Akbulut--Kirby family (1981), and we establish the AC-triviality of various potential counterexamples, including three infinite subfamilies, from the Miller--Schupp family (1991).

%     In the course of our study, we establish the AC-equivalence or AC-triviality of several significant potential counterexamples, including those from the Miller--Schupp family (1991) and the examples proposed by Akbulut and Kirby (1981).
