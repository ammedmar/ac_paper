	Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple angles, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the mathematical context defined by the Andrews--Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic improvements that can be relevant in other domains with ultra-sparse reward problems. Although our case study can be formulated as a game, its shortest winning sequences are potentially $10^6$ or $10^9$ times longer than those encountered in chess. In the process of our study, we establish AC-equivalences or AC-triviality of several notable potential counterexamples, including those from the Millerâ€“Schupp family (1991) or those proposed by Akbulut and Kirby back in 1981.
