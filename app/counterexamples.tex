\section{Potential Counterexamples}

While we focused on a subset of presentations from the Miller-Schupp series in this paper, there are a 

We mentioned some potential counterexamples of the Andrews-Curtis conjecture in the main text in section 2.2. Here, we mention some other potential counterexamples. 

A third series of potential counterexamples is due to Gordon \cite{Brown}:
\[
\G(m, n, p, q) \colon \angles{x, y \mid x = [x^m, y^n],\ y = [y^p, x^q]}.
\]
where $m,n,p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$.
All examples of this series with the total relator length of 14 are known
to be AC-trivializable \cite{Bowman-McCaul}
\footnote{Perform the same exercise as in the footnote above for this series.}
